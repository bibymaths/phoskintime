Scaling the data to t0 makes the model more stable. 
Not sure if this is the best way to do it.
No scaling to t0 results in FC = 1 for all time points, for some proteins. 
Scaling to t0 is not necessary for all proteins, some may require different scaling factors.
Why is it that scaling to t0 is not necessary for all proteins?
