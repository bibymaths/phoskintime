Welcome to the official documentation for **PhosKinTime**, an ODE-based modeling toolkit for phosphorylation kinetics and transcriptional time-series analysis. This index page provides an overview of each package and submodule in the project.

---

## Overview

PhosKinTime integrates:

- Parameter estimation (normal and sequential modes)
- Mechanistic ODE models (distributive, successive, random)
- Steady-state computation
- Morris sensitivity analysis
- Static and interactive visualization
- Modular design for extensibility

PhosKinTime uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model phosphorylation kinetics and supports multiple mechanistic hypotheses, including:
- **Distributive Model:** Phosphorylation events occur independently.
- **Successive Model:** Phosphorylation events occur sequentially.
- **Random Model:** Phosphorylation events occur in a random manner.

The package is designed with modularity in mind. It consists of several key components:
- **Configuration:** Centralized settings (paths, parameter bounds, logging, etc.) are defined in the config module.
- **Models:** Different ODE models (distributive, successive, random) are implemented to simulate phosphorylation.
- **Parameter Estimation:** Multiple routines (sequential and normal estimation) estimate kinetic parameters from experimental data.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Morris sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the influence of each parameter on the model output.
- **Steady-State Calculation:** Functions compute steady-state initial conditions for ODE simulation.
- **Utilities:** Helper functions support file handling, data formatting, report generation, and more.
- **Visualization:** A comprehensive plotting module generates static and interactive plots to visualize model fits, parameter profiles, PCA, t-SNE, and sensitivity indices.
- **Exporting:** The package can export results to Excel and generate HTML reports for easy sharing and documentation. 
- **CLI Interface:** A command-line interface allows users to run the package without needing to modify the code directly. 
- **Documentation:** The package includes extensive documentation to help users understand the functionality and usage of each module.
- **Testing:** The package includes unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented algorithms.
- **Logging:** A logging system is integrated to track the execution flow and capture important events during the analysis.
- **Error Handling:** The package includes error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and provide informative error messages.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The package is designed to work on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Version Control:** The package is version-controlled using Git, allowing users to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Continuous Integration:** The package is set up with continuous integration (CI) tools to automate testing and ensure code quality.
- **Documentation Generation:** The package uses tools like Sphinx to generate documentation from docstrings, making it easy to maintain and update the documentation as the code evolves.
- **Code Quality:** The package follows best practices for code quality, including PEP 8 style guidelines, type hints, and docstrings for functions and classes.
